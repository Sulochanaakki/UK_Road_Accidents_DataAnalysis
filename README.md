<h1 align="center">UK_Road_Accidents_DataAnalysis</h1>
<p align="center">The goal of this project is to analyse accidents and traffic data in the United Kingdom.The data are available for download on [link](https://data.world/datagov-uk/6efe5505-941f-45bf-b576-4c1e09b579a1)and contain UK government records of accidents from 2009 to 2018.Using python and its modules pandas, numpy, glob, folium and seaborn we will visualise different aspects of the data and try to get some insight into trends and evolution of accidents and traffic in the UK.</p>
.The datasets contains 15 features,
- Reference Number
- Easting
- Northing 
- Number of Vehicles
- Accident Date
- Time (24hr)
- 1st Road Class
- Road Surface
- Lighting Conditions
- Weather Conditions
- Casualty Class
- Casualty Class.1
- Casualty Severity
- Sex of Casualty
- Age of Casualty
- Type of Vehicle

Among these features there are two geospatial specific features namely eastings and northings of accidents.Given the easting and northing of a location, we can calculate the latitude and longitude of the location and vice versa.

All of the above features are making very interesting and comprehensive  for analysis and research
